## Short description

NOKA is a web application, especially aimed at teachers of the public administration in active service in the BAC (Basque Autonomous Community).
Here they can find information and useful tools, especially in the management of day-to-day administrative processes. Such as: civil service examinations, transfer competitions, pay slips...
In addition to being an informative space, the website has other areas such as:

- Queries: where users can send their questions, save questions from other users in their profile as favourites or search for existing questions filtering by tags and by date.

- Calculator: where users can make personalised calculations of the administrative process scales, based on their own selected information. You can also save these results in your profile, classifying us according to the process to which you belong. 

- Profile: your own profile area, where you can store your own information, save and access the queries you are interested in, the results of your calculator, as well as edit or delete them. 

The main objective is to simplify the personal management of public workers and all the processes they have to carry out outside their educational field.
